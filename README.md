# Swiggy Sales Analysis Using SQL Queries

## Problem Description 
Swiggy, one of India's leading online food delivery platforms, is looking to leverage its SQL database to extract business-critical insights that drive strategic decision-making. With the massive volume of daily transactions, customer interactions, and partner logistics, Swiggy needs a powerful backend analysis system to answer questions like:

- Who are the most loyal customers?

- Which cities drive the most revenue?

- Which delivery partners and restaurants are the top performers?

This project involves writing advanced SQL queries using joins, aggregations, and conditions to answer such business questions using the provided Swiggy dataset.

## Project Objective
1. Display all customers who live in 'Delhi'.
2. Find the average rating of all restaurants in 'Mumbai'.
3. List all customers who have placed at least one order.
4. Display the total number of orders placed by each customer.
5. Find the total revenue generated by each restaurant.
6. Find the top 5 restaurants with the highest average rating.
7. Display all customers who have never placed an order.
8. Find the number of orders placed by each customer in 'Mumbai'.
9. Display all orders placed in the last 30 days.
10. List all delivery partners who have completed more than 1 delivery
11. Find the customers who have placed orders on exactly three different days.
12. Find the delivery partner who has worked with the most different customers.
13. Identify customers who have the same city and have placed orders at the same restaurants, but on different dates.
